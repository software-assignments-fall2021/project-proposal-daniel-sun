#### By Daniel Sun

## What is this?

Music Sharing is an online website that allows people to share their playlists and comments on each song in the playlists. Also, other users can leave comments on others' playlists.

## Why do we need this?

On Spotify, we can create playlists but cannot make comments on each songs, and others cannot make comments on our playlists. This disadvantages prevents people that like same type of music sharing their feeling with each others. This app allows people to communicate with each others about their thoughts on music.

## For whom?
